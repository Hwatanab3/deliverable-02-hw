# Node.js + Sequelize + Express.js


## ðŸ’¾ USER DATABASE
The project is a DataBase that allows managing users using Express.js and Sequelize. It employs different controllers to handle user requests, process application logic, and return appropriate responses. The router defines routes for CRUD operations related to users, such as get all users, create a new user, get a user by its ID, update a user, and delete a user. This design follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern to organize the code in a modular and scalable manner.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a Front-end Developer and Architect, after modeling and rendering for a while, I moved into the world of PROGRAMMING. I enjoy creating experiences for everyone!

Among my successes, I highlight that during my training, I supported my colleagues to improve in different programming languages. I focus on the FrontEnd, although I do not abandon the BackEnd, which is of vital importance for the user experience.

I have experience developing web applications, and my dream is to create an ecosystem to merge my passions: programming and architecture. It would help society to provide access to Architectural and Urban design.
